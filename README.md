<h1>Bowling Game Simulation 🎳</h1> 

This project is a **Unity-based Bowling Game** that includes **basic gameplay mechanics** such as launching a ball, resetting pins, and tracking scores.

## Features ✨

- 🎯 **Launch Ball**: Press `Space` to launch the ball.
- 🎳 **Pin Reset**: Press `R` to reset the pins and ball position.
- 📊 **Score Tracking**: Automatically updates as pins are knocked down.
- 🏟 **Material Effects**: Uses **rough and smooth materials** to simulate realistic bowling physics.

## Controls 🎮

| Key      | Action                       |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `Space`  | Launch the ball             |
| `R`      | Reset the game              |
| `A / D`  | Move ball left / right      |

## Material Physics 🌟

To enhance realism, the game uses different **materials** for bowling interactions:

| Object       | Material Type  | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Ball**     | Smooth       | Low friction, allowing it to roll smoothly.   |
| **Lane**     | Smooth       | Minimal resistance for ball movement.         |
| **Pins**     | Slightly Rough | More realistic friction when hit by the ball.|
| **Gutters**  | Rough        | Increased friction to stop stray balls.       |

These **Physic Materials** are applied using Unity's **Physic Material** settings, which control friction and bounciness.
